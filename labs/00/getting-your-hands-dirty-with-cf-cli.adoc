= Introduction to CF CLI

- Change the working directory to be _devops-workshop-boeing/labs/samples_
+
Note the sub-directories present..
+
[source, bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
samples
├── go-sample
├── nodejs-sample
├── dotnet-core-sample
├── python-sample
---------------------------------------------------------------------
+
-> If you want to be able to deploy these samples you must have _Go_, _Node_, _.Net Core_, and _Python_ installed.

== How to target a foundation

. Open a Terminal (e.g., _cmd_ or _bash_ shell)

. Let's target a foundation
+
  cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io
+
Enter your PWS account username and password, then select an org and space.

== How to deploy an application

. Let's take a look at the CF CLI options
+
  cf --help

. Let's see what buildpacks are available to us
+
  cf buildpacks

. Peruse the services you can provision and bind your applications to
+
  cf marketplace
  
. Time to deploy an app. How about Node.js? 
+
  cd nodejs-sample
  cf push cf-nodejs -c "node server.js"
  
. Next, let's try deploying a Python app.
+
  cd ../python-sample
  cf push my_pyapp
  
. Rinse and repeat for .Net Core and Go apps
+
  cd ../dotnet-core-sample
  cf push
  cd ../go-sample
  cf push awesome-go-app -m 64M --random-route
  
. Check what applications have been deployed so far
+
  cf apps
+
-> Take some time to visit each of the applications you've just deployed.

. Let's stop an app, then check that it has indeed been stopped
+
  cf stop cf-nodejs
  cf apps
  
== How to cleanup after yourself

. Finally, let's delete an app
+
  cf delete cf-nodejs
+  
-> Repeat `cf delete` for each app you deployed.
